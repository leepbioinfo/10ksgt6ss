# Data README

## Overview

This directory contains all the data files used in the analyses presented in this project.
Each file corresponds to a specific dataset or intermediate result, and serves as input or output for the various analysis steps, supporting full reproducibility and traceability.

## Data description


- **10k_vizinho_novo_df_jaccard.pkl**: Script to filter results from the T6SSiii_tssH model (which retrieves many non-T6SS proteins) and fetch 10 genes upstream and downstream of the identified T6SS components.
- **FDEvolvedCargo5.xlsx**: Script that uses the filtered data and classifies T6SS clusters using Jaccard and Louvain algorithms..
- **Toxins_nomenclature 05-01-2024.xlsx**: Script that generates multiple dataframes incorporating manually curated annotations; these final dataframes serve as the basis for figure generation and statistical analyses.
- **from_rob.xlsx**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **function2color.yaml**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **jaccard_group_classification.yaml**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **jaccard_type_classification.yaml**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **meta_s3.xlsx**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **model2function.yaml**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **rename_model_name.yaml**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
- **toxdist4.xlsx**: Scripts used to generate the figures for the final manuscript; some figures may have been subsequently edited with image software to enhance their aesthetics.
