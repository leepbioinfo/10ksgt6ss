The PAAR domain is widespread, but this model represents a narrow clade that may occur in type VI secretion systems (T6SS), either free-standing or fused to a long extension. Effector domains of T6SS may be separate proteins, or may be fused to on of the tube or spike proteins: VgrG (spike), Hcp (tube), or this PAAR family (spike tip).

Hcp1 lacks a conventional signal sequence and is instead exported by means of the type VI secretion system, encoded by a pathogenicity cluster of a class previously designated IAHP (IcmF-associated homologous protein). Homologs of Hcp1, in this protein family, are found in various bacteria of which most but not all are known pathogens.

This domain is found in the PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily, where it forms a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike, a trimeric protein complex of the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS). The T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide variety of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells. The pointed tip of the PAAR domain is stabilized by a zinc atom positioned close to the cone's vertex and is likely to be important for its integrity during penetration of the target cell envelope. The PAAR-repeat proteins form a diverse superfamily with several subgroups extended both N- and C-terminally by domains with various predicted functions; the termini are exposed to solution, and do not distort the VgrG binding site. VgrG proteins are orthologous to the central baseplate spikes of bacteriophages with contractile tails, and genes encoding proteins with PAAR motifs have been frequently found immediately downstream from vgrG-like genes. It has been shown that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae (encodes two PAAR proteins) and Acinetobacter baylyi (encodes three PAAR proteins); inactivation of all these PAAR genes results in inactivation of Hcp secretion as well as T6SS-dependent killing of E. coli.	77

IcmF as a whole interacts with DotU whereby these bind tightly and form the docking area of the T6SS within the inner membrane. The exact function of this domain is not clear.	201
377715	pfam06812	ImpA_N	ImpA, N-terminal, type VI secretion system. This family represents a conserved region located towards the N-terminal end of ImpA and related proteins. ImpA is an inner membrane protein, which has been suggested to be involved with proteins that are exported and associated with colony variations in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The ImpA gene in Vibrio cholera and many other bacteria is expressed from the virulence factor operon which produces the pathogenic injection, type VI secretion system; although the exact function of this gene-product is not known it appears to be an essential component of the pathogenic effect.	119
377755	pfam06996	T6SS_TssG	Type VI secretion, TssG. This is a family of Gram-negative bacterial proteins that form part of the type VI pathogenicity secretion system (T6SS), including TssG. TssG is homologs to phage tail proteins and is required for proper assembly of the Hcp tube in bacteria.One other member in this family, SciB (Q93IT4) from Salmonella enterica, is thought to be involved in virulence.	303
378275	pfam09850	DotU	Type VI secretion system protein DotU. DotU is a family of Gram-negative bacterial proteins that form part of the membrane-joining complex of the type VI secretion system. DotU binds tightly to IcmF and together they are tethered to the inner membrane at one end and the peptidoglycan layer at the other; they interact with Lip1 which then tethers the peptidoglycan layer to the outer membrane.	204
378637	pfam11319	VasI	Type VI secretion system VasI, EvfG, VC_A0118. VasI is a family of Gram-negative proteins that form part of the pathogenicity apparatus for bacteria-to-bacteria attack. The exact function of this component is not known.	183
372143	pfam12486	VasL	Type VI secretion system, EvfB, or VasL. EvfB or VasL is a domain found on many Gram-negative proteins with an ImpA_N domain at the N-terminus. These proteins are expressed from the pathogenicity locus that forms the bacterial type VI secretion system. The exact function of VasL is not known. One E.coli member is annotated as being EvfB, though the E.coli equivalent of ImpA would be expected to be EvfG. It is possible that in many bacteria what is a single protein in one species, eg E.coli, is a fusion of two genes in others, which would explain an ImpA at the N-terminus and a VasL at the C-terminus.	147
378947	pfam12790	T6SS-SciN	Type VI secretion lipoprotein, VasD, EvfM, TssJ, VC_A0113. One of the virulence mechanisms of E coli is the production of toxins which it produces from dedicated machineries called secretion systems. Seven secretion systems have been described, which assemble from 3 to up to more than 20 subunits. These secretion systems derive from or have co-evolved with bacterial organelles such as ABC transporters (type I), type IV pili (type 2), flagella (type 3), or conjugative machines (type IV). The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is present in most pathogens that have contact with animals, plants, or humans. SciN is a lipoprotein tethered to the outer membrane and expressed in the periplasm of E coli and is essential for T6S-dependent secretion of the Hcp-like SciD protein and for biofilm formation.	120

T6SS has roles in interspecies interactions, as well as higher order host-infection, by injecting effector proteins into the periplasmic compartment of the recipient cells of closely related species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces at least three effector proteins to other cells and thus has three specific cognate immunity proteins to protect itself. Tae4, or type VI amidase effector 4, in Enterobacter cloacae has a cognate Tai4 or type VI amidase immunity 4 protein. The immunity protein is Tai4, pfam16695.	118

T6SS has roles in interspecies interactions, as well as higher order host-infection, by injecting effector proteins into the periplasmic compartment of the recipient cells of closely related species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces at least three effector proteins to other cells and thus has three specific cognate immunity proteins to protect itself. Tae4, or type VI amidase effector 4, in Enterobacter cloacae has a cognate Tai4 or type VI amidase immunity 4 protein. The effector is Tae4, pfam14113.	91

379983	pfam17643	TssR	Type VI secretion system, TssR. T6SSs are toxin delivery systems. It is a multiprotein complex requiring numerous core proteins (Tss proteins) including cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and outer membrane components. The needle or tube apparatus is comprised of a phage-like complex, similar to the T4 contractile bacteriophage tail, which is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a trans-envelope complex. This entry relates to TssR family members. TssR proteins have no predicted TM regions.	750
375677	pfam18250	Tgi2PP	Effector immunity protein Tgi2PP. This domain is Tgi2PP found in Pseudomonas protegens. Tgi2PP is part of the Tge2PP- Tgi2PP Effector-immunity pair secreted by the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Tgi2PP interacts predominantly by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with Tge2PP via the insertion of the beta-sheet core of Tgi2PP into the substrate-binding groove of Tge2PP. Tgi2PP contains a similar topology to the periplasmic E. coli colicin M immunity protein.	45
376074	pfam18648	ADPRTs_Tse2	Tse2 ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins. Tse2 from P. aeruginosa has structural features similar to ADP-ribosylating toxins. It is a cytoactive toxin secreted by a type six secretion apparatus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and found mostly in gamma proteobacteria. It naturally attacks a target in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells. Structural analysis shows similarity between Tse2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent enzymes from bacteria, notably the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins (ADPRTs). Furthermore, it revealed that the Tse2 active site is occluded upon binding the cognate immunity protein Tsi2. The abrogation of toxicity for the R14A, S80A, and H122A mutant Tse2 proteins indicates the importance of these amino acids in the mechanism of Tse2 toxicity and, given their conservation with NAD-reactive enzymes, also supports their assignment as being involved in a catalytic reaction.	146
0	cd20701	MIX	Marker for type sIX effectors domain. This family contains the MIX (Marker for type sIX effectors) domain, a marker of type VI secretion system (T6SS) effectors carrying polymorphic C-terminal toxins. MIX domains have been classified into five clans (called MIX I-V) by Dar et. al. based on sequence similarity. These domains have been further classified as either antibacterial or anti-eukaryotic, based on the presence or absence of adjacent putative immunity genes, respectively. In Vibrionaceae, antibacterial MIX-effectors carrying domains with pore-forming, phospholipase, nuclease, peptidoglycan hydrolase, and protease activities have been identified. Additionally, novel virulence MIX-effectors that employ a combination of antibacterial and anti-eukaryotic MIX-effectors have been found, suggesting that certain bacteria adapted their antibacterial T6SS to mediate interactions with eukaryotic hosts or predators. A subset of polymorphic MIX-effectors, a widespread class of effectors secreted by T6SSs, are horizontally shared between marine bacteria and used to diversify their T6SS effector repertoires, thus enhancing their environmental fitness.	0
